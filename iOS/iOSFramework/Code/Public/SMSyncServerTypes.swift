/* [1]. I'm using AFNetworking internally, and it is uploading numbers in JSON as quoted strings. I'm not sure why. Other people have seen this (e.g., http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20136567/afnetworking-json-serialization-problems). In the upload server API call, the JSON arrives this way. My app-local JSON serialization (see SMLocalFile.swift) doesn't appear to do this. This doesn't seem to be due to use of AFHTTPRequestSerializer vs. AFJSONRequestSerializer. I should put in a question to the AFNetworking folks about this. HOWEVER, I should, before that, try a simple example where I use Postman or cURL to upload, and a simple Node.js backend to see what is received on the server with something sent like {"Test" : 1}. It could be that something on the server side is decoding the JSON in the body of the HTTP request in this way.
