// SETUP: (1) Server must be running, (2) Typically before running the test(s), you have to first (a) delete the app, then (b) build and launch the app and ensure the user is signed in. And then, (c) stop the app, and run the test.

// TODO: TimedCallback.withDuration is used to wait for user sign-in, but can now be replaced below with a call to a sign in completion handler. This should speed up testing.

    // I have sometimes been getting test failures where it looks like the callback is not defined. i.e., there are no entries in the particular callbacks array. However, the callback was defined. This takes the form of an array index out-of-bounds crash. What was happening is that the timeout was exceeded on the prior test, and so XCTests moved on to the next test, but the prior test was actually still running-- interacting with the server. And when it finished, it tried doing the callbacks, which were no longer defined as the setup had been done for the next test. The cure was to extend the duration of the timeouts.
