    // Nested key:
    public static let cloudFolderPath = "CloudFolderPath"
    // Value: The path into the cloud storage system where the files will be stored. *All* files are stored in a single folder in the cloud storage system. Currently, this *must* be a folder immediately off of the root. E.g., /Petunia. Subfolders (e.g., /Petunia/subfolder) are not allowable currently.

    // Key:
    public static let operationIdKey = "OperationId"

    // Only used in development, not in production.
    // Key:
