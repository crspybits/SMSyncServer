    /* Need to compare our local files against the server files to see which we need to download. Cases:
    1) Server files which don't yet exist on the app/client.
        i.e., the UUID isn't on the client.
    2) Server files which are updated versions of those on app/client.
        i.e., client version is N, server version is N+M, M > 0.
        The simplest case of this is the client has version N, and the server has version N+1. This means that another client, with the same cloud storage user info, has made an update to the file.
        If the server version is N+2, then it just means that two updates have occurred from other client(s).
        Etc.
    3) Server files which are in update conflict with those on the app/client.
        This can be detected when the app/client file has changed (current version is N, which should be uploaded as N+1 to the server) but there is also an update on the server. To have no conflict with the server, the server file version should currently be N. A conflict is detected when the server version is N+M, M > 0.
    4) Files which are in deletion conflict with those on the app/client. This can happen in one of two ways:
        a) The file has been deleted on the server, but updated on the client.
        b) The file has been updated on the server, but deleted on the client.
        (Notes: The case of update on the server and update on the client is an update conflict, see case 3. The case of deletion on the client and deletion on the server poses no conflict-- the file needs to be deleted on the client.)
