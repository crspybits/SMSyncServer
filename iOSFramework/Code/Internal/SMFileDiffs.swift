// Internal framework class to represent the collection of files that need to be uploaded to the server, or downloaded from the server.

// TODO: There is a potential race condition with any code that (a) accesses the collection of meta data, and (b) runs in a different thread than the application code. I.e., what happens if the SMLocalFile meta data gets changed while this class is accessing that meta data? It seems best to provide a level of locking where when this class accesses the SMLocalFile meta data, no other thread can access that meta data. E.g., this could be done by providing a lock specific to the SMLocalFile class which must be obtained prior to creating or altering an SMLocalFile's.

internal enum InitType : Equatable {
    // SMLocalFile meta data is used to see if there are any updates needing to be uploaded.
    case LocalChanges
    
    // Provides value for the serverFileIndex member var to the init method.
    case RemoteChanges(serverFileIndex:[SMServerFile])
}

// When you have associated values with an enum, you have to manufacture equality yourself. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24339807/how-to-test-equality-of-swift-enums-with-associated-values
// This is just a coarse measure of equality-- doesn't take into account associated values of RemoteChanges.

Up until this date, this array was of type SMLocalFile, but we could run into situations where, if we did an upload, commit, quickly followed by an upload and commit on the same file, we'd not get the upload of the first file. Another way of saying this is that we need to call getMostRecentChangeAndFlush at the very beginning of the commit process. See test testThatUpdateAfterUploadWorks().
