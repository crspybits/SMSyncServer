        A) the app starts
        B) the network comes back online
        C) we get a WebSocket request from the server to do so.

    The priority of the sync operations are:
        TODO: Recovery must take first priority.
     
        1) If pending downloads (assumes we have a server lock), do those.
            Pending downloads include download-conflicts (which are given first priority within downloads), download-deletions, and plain downloads of files.
        2) If pending uploads (also assumes we have a server lock), do those.
            Pending uploads include upload-deletions and plain uploads of files.
            While the ordering of this pending uploads check appears to be higher priority than than the check for downloads in 4), the only way we actually achieve pending uploads is in 5).
        3) Check for downloads (assumes we don't have a lock). This check can result in downloads, download-deletions, and download-conflicts, so we need to go back to 1).
        4) If there are committed uploads, assign a queue of those as pending uploads, go back to 3) (requires a lock created during checking for downloads).
