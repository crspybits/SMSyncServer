The structure of files & directories represented by the SyncServer.

We will not represent files in the long-term, but rather we'll represent:

a) A group of files being uploaded, that will later be sent to cloud storage.
    The files are uploaded by a specific user/device.

b) A group of files being downloaded-- that are first received from cloud storage.
    The files are being downloaded by a specific user/device.

It would seem to make sense to organize:
1) Separately by uploads vs. downloads,
2) Within those categories by the user/device identifiers.

So, I'm going to use the following directory structures:

1) uploads/
    user1.device1/
        files being uploaded...

    user2.device1/
        files being uploaded...

    etc.

2) And a similar structure for a downloads/ directory.

3) Each file within the userN.deviceM directories will be the UUID of the file assigned by the app.

Each of the files within the specific directories will be removed after its specific upload or download has been assured.
Each userN.deviceM directory will be removed once its set of uploads or downloads is complete.
