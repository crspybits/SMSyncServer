"Note: Save refresh tokens in secure long-term storage and continue to use them as long as they remain valid. Limits apply to the number of refresh tokens that are issued per client-user combination, and per user across all clients, and these limits are different. If your application requests enough refresh tokens to go over one of the limits, older refresh tokens stop working."

/* Errors:

1) Error: invalid_client
	Solution: I went into the Google API console and made a specific Web set of credentials for the server.
	
2) Error: unauthorized_client
	I tried adding in the scope I was using to the iOS app, but that didn't work.
	It appears that you cannot refresh using a different client:
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13871982/unable-to-refresh-access-token-response-is-unauthorized-client
	So, it seems that my algorithm is wrong. I was assuming you could pass the refresh token from the iOS app
	to the server and do a refresh.
